# C++ Design Patterns

Software design patterns are general reusable solutions to problems which occur over and over again in object-oriented design enviroment. It is not a finished design that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is template how to solve the problem.

We can classify them by purpose into creational (abstract the instantiation process), structure (how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures) and behavioral patterns (the assignment of responsibilities between objects).

### Creational Patterns
- Singleton, the sole instance of a class 

### Structural Patterns

### Behavioral Patterns
